# Front end technical test

Congratulations! If you're looking at this you probably have an interview with Oodle!

![Great job](https://media.giphy.com/media/xHMIDAy1qkzNS/giphy.gif)

You have **2 hours** to complete the challenge. If you run out of time before you complete the task to your own satisfaction, just *stay calm and push your code*. We are mostly interested in how you approach the problem and what your priorities were during the time.

## Instructions

### The project

Here is an endpoint that returns a list of beers: https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers.

We want you to fetch data from that API and display it in an organized way using [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

You can display the data in any way that makes sense to you: a list, a table, even a graph if that's your style! (Note to grad/junior devs: a graph is likely much more difficult and time-consuming than a list or a table.)

### What are we looking for?
- Good React knowledge
- CSS Competency
- Fetching and Handling Data Asynchronously

### More specifics
- you may use any 3rd-party libraries you wish but you must write at least some custom styles to demonstrate your knowledge of CSS
- don't worry about supporting IE11
- you don't have to deploy your result but can if you wish. Either way we'll pull down the code and run it locally.

### Want more of a challenge or to go the extra mile?
Here's [the full documentation](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) for the punkapi. Go nuts ðŸ¥œ.

Some ideas for things you could add include: 
- filtering by brewed_before and/or brewed_after dates
- filtering by ABV (alcohol by volume)
- searching by beer_name
- adding a button to search for a random beer

## Okay I did it. What now?
Send us the link to your repo. We'll take a look at it, and if we like what we see we'll invite you to discuss it during a technical interview.
